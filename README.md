# Bolt.diy (Previously oTToDev)

Welcome to Bolt.diy, the official open source version of Bolt.new (previously known as oTToDev and Bolt.new ANY LLM), which allows you to choose the LLM that you use for each prompt! Currently, you can use OpenAI, Anthropic, Ollama, OpenRouter, Gemini, LMStudio, Mistral, xAI, HuggingFace, DeepSeek, or Groq models - and it is easily extended to use any other model supported by the Vercel AI SDK! See the instructions below for running this locally and extending it to include more models.

Check the [Bolt.diy Docs](https://stackblitz-labs.github.io/bolt.diy/) for more information. This documentation is still being updated after the transfer.

Bolt.diy was originally started by [Cole Medin](https://www.youtube.com/@ColeMedin) but has quickly grown into a massive community effort to build the BEST open source AI coding assistant!

## Setup Bolt.diy 

If you're new to installing software from GitHub, don't worry! If you encounter any issues, feel free to submit an "issue" using the provided links or improve this documentation by forking the repository, editing the instructions, and submitting a pull request. The following instruction will help you get the stable branch up and running on your local machine in no time.  

### Prerequisites  

1. **Install Git**: [Download Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)  
2. **Install Node.js**: [Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)  

   - After installation, the Node.js path is usually added to your system automatically. To verify:  
     - **Windows**: Search for "Edit the system environment variables," click "Environment Variables," and check if `Node.js` is in the `Path` variable.  
     - **Mac/Linux**: Open a terminal and run:  
       ```bash  
       echo $PATH  
       ```  
       Look for `/usr/local/bin` in the output.  

### Clone the Repository  

Clone the repository using Git:  

```bash  
git clone -b stable https://github.com/stackblitz-labs/bolt.diy  
```  

### (Optional) Configure Environment Variables  

Most environment variables can be configured directly through the settings menu of the application. However, if you need to manually configure them:  

1. Rename `.env.example` to `.env.local`.  
2. Add your LLM API keys. For example:  

```env  
GROQ_API_KEY=YOUR_GROQ_API_KEY  
OPENAI_API_KEY=YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY  
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=YOUR_ANTHROPIC_API_KEY  
```  

**Note**: Ollama does not require an API key as it runs locally.  

3. Optionally, set additional configurations:  

```env  
# Debugging  
VITE_LOG_LEVEL=debug  

# Ollama settings (example: 8K context, localhost port 11434)  
OLLAMA_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:11434  
DEFAULT_NUM_CTX=8192  
```  

**Important**: Do not commit your `.env.local` file to version control. This file is already included in `.gitignore`.

## Run the Application  

### Option 1: Without Docker

1. **Install Dependencies**:  
   ```bash  
   pnpm install  
   ```  
   If `pnpm` is not installed, install it using:  
   ```bash  
   sudo npm install -g pnpm  
   ```  

2. **Start the Application**:  
   ```bash  
   pnpm run dev  
   ```
   This will start the Remix Vite development server. You will need Google Chrome Canary to run this locally if you use Chrome! It's an easy install and a good browser for web development anyway.  

### Option 2: With Docker  

#### Prerequisites  
- Ensure Git, Node.js, and Docker are installed: [Download Docker](https://www.docker.com/)  

#### Steps  

1. **Build the Docker Image**:  

   Use the provided NPM scripts:  
   ```bash  
   npm run dockerbuild       # Development build  
   npm run dockerbuild:prod  # Production build  
   ```  

   Alternatively, use Docker commands directly:  
   ```bash  
   docker build . --target bolt-ai-development  # Development build  
   docker build . --target bolt-ai-production   # Production build  
   ```  

2. **Run the Container**:  
   Use Docker Compose profiles to manage environments:  
   ```bash  
   docker-compose --profile development up  # Development  
   docker-compose --profile production up   # Production  
   ```  

   - With the development profile, changes to your code will automatically reflect in the running container (hot reloading).

### Update Your Local Version to the Latest

To keep your local version of Bolt.diy up to date with the latest changes, follow these steps for your operating system:

#### 1. **Navigate to your project folder**  
   Navigate to the directory where you cloned the repository and open a terminal:

#### 2. **Fetch the Latest Changes**  
   Use Git to pull the latest changes from the main repository:

   ```bash
   git pull origin main
   ```

#### 3. **Update Dependencies**  
   After pulling the latest changes, update the project dependencies by running the following command:

   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

#### 4. **Run the Application**  
   Once the updates are complete, you can start the application again with:

   ```bash
   pnpm run dev
   ```

This ensures that you're running the latest version of Bolt.diy and can take advantage of all the newest features and bug fixes.
