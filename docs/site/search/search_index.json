That\u2019s where Bolt.new stands out:</p> <ul> <li>Full-Stack in the Browser: Bolt.new integrates cutting-edge AI models with an in-browser development environment powered by StackBlitz\u2019s WebContainers. This allows you to:</li> <li>Install and run npm tools and libraries (like Vite, Next.js, and more)</li> <li>Run Node.js servers</li> <li>Interact with third-party APIs</li> <li>Deploy to production from chat</li> <li> <p>Share your work via a URL</p> </li> <li> <p>AI with Environment Control: Unlike traditional dev environments where the AI can only assist in code generation, Bolt.new gives AI models complete control over the entire  environment including the filesystem, node server, package manager, terminal, and browser console. This empowers AI agents to handle the whole app lifecycle\u2014from creation to deployment.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Whether you\u2019re an experienced developer, a PM, or a designer, Bolt.new allows you to easily build production-grade full-stack applications.</p> <p>For developers interested in building their own AI-powered development tools with WebContainers, check out the open-source Bolt codebase in this repo!</p>"},{"location":"#setup","title":"Setup","text":"<p>Many of you are new users to installing software from Github.

But you can check your path if you want to be sure. On Windows, you can search for \"edit the system environment variables\" in your system, select \"Environment Variables...\" once you are in the system properties, and then check for a path to Node in your \"Path\" system variable. On a Mac or Linux machine, it will tell you to check if /usr/local/bin is in your $PATH. To determine if usr/local/bin is included in $PATH\u00a0open your Terminal and run:</p> <pre><code>echo $PATH\u00a0.\n</code></pre> <p>If you see usr/local/bin in the output then you're good to go.</p> <ol> <li>Clone the repository (if you haven't already) by opening a Terminal window (or CMD with admin permissions) and then typing in this:</li> </ol> <pre><code>git clone https://github.com/coleam00/bolt.new-any-llm.git\n</code></pre> <ol> <li>Rename .env.example to .env.local and add your LLM API keys.

This helps Bolt understand the foundation of your project and ensure everything is wired up right before building out more advanced functionality.</p> </li> <li> <p>Batch simple instructions: Save time by combining simple instructions into one message. For example, you can ask Bolt to change the color scheme, add mobile responsiveness, and restart the dev server, all in one go saving you time and reducing API credit consumption significantly.</p> </li> </ul>"}]}
